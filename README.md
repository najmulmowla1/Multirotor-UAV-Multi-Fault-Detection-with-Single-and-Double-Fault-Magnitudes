# -Multirotor-UAV-Multi-Fault-Detection--with-Single-and-Double-Fault-Magnitudes
Implements two different lightweight architectures, CLFDNet and AELMFNet, combining multi-branch 1D CNNs and LSTM–attention for single and double fault-magnitude classification in multirotor UAVs, comparing six loss functions for efficient onboard health monitoring.
